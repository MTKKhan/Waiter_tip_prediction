# Waiter_tip_prediction

In this project, a machine learning-based model was developed to predict waiter tips, using a dataset of over 400 dining transactions. The process began with meticulous data collection, followed by thorough data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify patterns and relationships within the data, leading to meaningful insights that guided the feature engineering process.

Feature engineering played a crucial role in enhancing the model's predictive power, as key variables were created and refined to capture the nuances of tipping behavior. Data visualization techniques were employed to present the data in a clear and comprehensible manner, facilitating deeper understanding and communication of findings.

Multiple machine learning algorithms were explored, with the final model achieving a 95% accuracy in predicting tips. The model was rigorously evaluated using performance metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared values, ensuring its reliability and robustness. The entire system was then integrated into a Python application, providing an intuitive interface for users to input data and receive instant tip predictions. This project demonstrates the successful application of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem, offering valuable insights into customer tipping behavior.
